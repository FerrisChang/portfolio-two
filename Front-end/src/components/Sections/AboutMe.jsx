      <p>Hello again! Let me reintroduce myself I'm Ferris. I am passionate about <span className='special-font-color'>Software Engineering</span>.
      I'm local to the Northern Virginia DMV area. My main tech stack is <span className='special-font-color'>MERN</span>, but I am always expanding my skill set and learning
      different languages and tools. I am excited to work with others of the same interest and being able to collaborate to accomplish difficult tasks.
      Over the years I have led many different teams all with an array of different backgrounds, because of this it has provided me insight about the strengths that 
      having a diverse group team members can provide. If given the chance I know that I can make a positive impact to any company that I work for just like I
      have done in the past while working for the Navy, Germanna, Amazon and RafiqCodes.
