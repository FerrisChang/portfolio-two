Hello,

Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to visit my portfolio! This is a huge step for me on my road to becoming a better software developer.
I really look forward to speaking to you in the future. I know that whatever organization that I work for next will benefit by having me on their team,
hopefully it is yours, but even if not let's stay connected on Linkedin or Github maybe we can collaborate on a project. Thank you again for visiting me!

Very best regards,
Ferris Chang
